            Stone Island is known by its compass patch that buttons onto the upper sleeve of the left arm.[2]

Originally the patches were green edged, badges from around the year 2000 onwards became black edged. There are also a run of rarer 'white badges' which were originally made on certain jackets to celebrate the new millennium. The white badge is now apparent on jackets that use materials that Stone Island develops themselves in-house. Novel jacket designs include the "Liquid Reflective" jacket, that uses thousands of small shards of glass that reflect light.

From the mid 1990s the make has been popular in the football casual subculture in England and throughout the rest of Europe.[3] The brand is often associated with hooliganism and can be seen in many football hooliganism based films, such as Green Street Hooligans and The Football Factory. Canadian rapper Drake is also regularly seen wearing Stone Island, and has helped popularize the brand in hip hop culture.
